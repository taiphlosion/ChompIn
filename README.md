## Tech Stack 🧑‍💻

### Frontend 📱

- Expo Go
- TypeScript #️⃣

### Backend
- Node.js and Express
- PostgreSQL database 🖧
- JWT for authentication 🔐

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `client/`: Contains the React Native mobile application
- `server/`: Contains the Express.js backend server

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go
- Docker 🐳

### Setup ⚙️
- There are appropriate READMEs in both the client and server directory with more detailed instructions. 📂
- If you are demoing on mobile, have a separate `.env` file in the `client` directory. Make a variable called `API_URL` formatted as: `http://[IP address of your dev machine]:[your port but I just use 5000]`
- The `server` directory should have the `.env` file located at its root
- I recommend having at least two terminals, one for the client and the server for server. 📟
